			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h3>How do I update my Website?</h3>
					<p>Your Website will be hosted on GitHub, that is both your website code and content are stored in a repository on GitHub. You can access your repository from any device such as a cell phone using a browser. Every time you make a change to your repository, Github  automatically deploys your changes to your live site. There is no need for a CMS (Content Management System) or other complex tools, simply select a file, make your changes by editing it, and then save.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Do I need to purchase a domain name?</h3>
					<p>Yes, you are responsible for registering your domain and paying applicable fees (around 15â‚¬ per year). I recommend <a href="https://www.hover.com/">hover.com</a> for registering a domain.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>How long does it take until my Website goes live?</h3>
					<p>The process of designing and developing your Website usually takes around one month. If you have already finalized the content of your website the progress will be faster.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Is there a warranty?</h3>
					<p>Yes, your website comes with a lifetime warranty that it will look and function flawlessly on latest version of all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) on smart phones, tablets, and desktop computers. This warranty is void if you or someone else tampers with the underlying code of your website.</p>
