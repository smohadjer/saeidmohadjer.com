                    <p>I created this SPA so that my friends and I could keep track of our poker tournaments. The app is built without using any frameworks or state management libraries, nevertheless it offers everything that modern web apps do including ability to bookmark every page or go back and forth in browser's history. Players can see results of each game, rankings for current and past seasons, profiles of players and so on. The frontend stack is TypeScript, HTML, and CSS and two open-source libraries: chart.js and handlebars.js. For backend I used MongoDB and Node.js. Communication between server and client is done via serverless TypeScript endpoints hosted on Vercel. Views are rendered by injecting data fetched via TypeScript into Handlebars templates. API authorization for post requests is implemented via JWT tokens inside a middleware. Code is available on <a href="https://github.com/smohadjer/pokerrangliste">GitHub</a></p>

						<p>Designed and developed a responsive Website with protected admin area for tennis trainer Slaven Gluscevic. Users can register for training courses and tennis camps while admin can view and edit registration data, update his availability schedule (which is visible to users in registration pages), and so on. Content is updated on GitHub and changes in code or content trigger a deployment on Vercel which runs a build process I wrote from scratch using Node.js and NPM scripts. Backend consists exclusively of api endpoints which are serverless functions written in TypeScript that read and write to a MongoDB instance on the cloud. The full stack runs free of any costs on the cloud using free services from GitHub, Vercel, and MongoDB.</p>
