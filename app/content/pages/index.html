			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<h3>How do I update my Website?</h3>
			<p>Your Website will be hosted on GitHub, that is both your website code and content are stored in a repository on GitHub. You can access your repository from any device such as a cell phone using a browser. Every time you make a change to your repository, Github  automatically deploys your changes to your live site. There is no need for a CMS (Content Management System) or other complex tools, simply select a file, make your changes by editing it, and then save.</p>

			<h3>Do I need a domain name?</h3>
			<p>Yes, you are responsible for registering your domain name and paying annual fee (around 15â‚¬/year). When your website is ready for release, we will link your domain to your GitHub Pages IP Address by updating some records in your DNS settings.</p>
			
			<h3>How long does it take to launch my new Website?</h3>
			<p>It usually takes around one month to design, build and push your site live. If you have already prepared the content of your website (text and visual assets) the progress will be faster.</p>
			
			<h3>Is there a warranty?</h3>
			<p>Yes, your website comes with a lifetime warranty that it will look and function flawlessly on latest version of all modern browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) on smart phones, tablets, and desktop computers. This warranty is void as soon as you or someone else tampers with the underlying code of your website.</p>
