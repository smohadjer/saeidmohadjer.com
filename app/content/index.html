			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<h3>How do I update my Website?</h3>
			<p>Your Website will be hosted on GitHub, that is both your website code and content are stored in a repository on GitHub. You can access your repository from any device such as a cell phone using a browser. Every time you make a change to your repository, Github  automatically deploys your changes to your live site. No need for a CMS or other complex content management tools, simply select a file, make your changes by editing it, and then save.</p>
			
			<h3>Do I need a domain name?</h3>
			<p>Yes, you are responsible for registering your domain name and paying annual fees ( around 15$). When your website is ready for release, we will link your domain to your GitHub Pages IP Address by updating some records in your DNS settings.</p>
			
			<h3>Can I have a custom design or functionality that is not presented on demo website?</h3>
			<p>Yes, you certainly can, but that may incur additional charges. The basic price of 1000 Euro assumes your site will use the default layout and components. If you need a design or component that is drastically different from what is presented on demo site, we will discuss your requirements and provide an estimate of costs.</p>
			
			<h3>How long does it take to deliver my new Website?</h3>
			<p>It usually takes one month to design, build and push your site live. If you have already prepared the content of your website (text and visual assets) the progress will be faster.</p>
					
			<h3>How would I be charged?</h3>
			<p>An invoice will be issued after your website is delivered and is live. If there are no additional requirements from your side the invoice amount will be the basic price of 1000€ plus value added tax if applicable (19% for clients in Germany). No advance payment required. No contract necessary.</p>
			
			<h3>Is there a warranty?</h3>
			<p>Yes, your website comes with a lifetime warranty that it will look and function flawlessly on latest version of all modern browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) on smart phones, tablets, and desktop computers. This warranty is void as soon as you or someone else tampers with the underlying code of your website.</p>
