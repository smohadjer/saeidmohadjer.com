			<p>Do you need a website that looks great on any device, loads fast, and can be updated even from your phone? Then this is a service for you.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Do I need a server for my Website?</h3>
		<p>No, you don’t. Your website will be hosted on GitHub. GitHub offers free storage and hosting for public repositories. You can access your GitHub repository from any device meaning that you can even update your site directly from your cell phone. Every time you make a change on Github, it will automatically update your live site for you within a minute.</p>
		
		<h3>Can I host my website on my own server?</h3>
		<p>Yes, but then you need to contact your server's administrator to figure out how to update your website.</p>
		
		<h3>Do I need a domain name?</h3>
		<p>Yes, you are responsible for registering your domain name and paying annual fee (usually around 15€ per year) as well as pointing your domain to your GitHub page. Instructions for this will be provided to you via email and I can help you with this process if you need assistance.</p>
		
		<h3>Can I have a different design or functionality byond what is presented on demo website?</h3>
		<p>If you need a design that is considerably different from the demo website, it will incur additional costs to implement it, however minor changes in layout can be accomodated at no extra cost. Same is true for custom functionalities.</p>
		
		<h3>Can I update content of my Website?</h3>
		<p>Yes, you can update content of your website from any device directly in the browser on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. Your website code and content will be stored on a repository on GitHub. The changes you make there will go live within a minute using an automated deployment process. No need to learn to use a CMS or install anything.</p>
		<!-- add a link to a page that has instructions on how to update content of site on github with screennshots or add a videocast here-->
		
		<h3>How long does it take you to deliver my Website?</h3>
		<p>It usually takes 10 to 15 days to design, build and push your site live. If you have already prepared the content of your website (text and visual assets such as photos) the progress will be faster.</p>
				
		<h3>How would I be charged?</h3>
		<p>An invoice will be issued after your website is delivered and is live. If there are no additional requirements from your side the invoice amount will be the basic price of 1000€ plus value added tax if applicable (19% for clients in Gremany). No advance payment required. No contract necessary.</p>
		
		<h3>Is there a warranty?</h3>
		<p>Yes, your website comes with a life-time warranty that it will look and function flawlessly on latest version of all modern browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) on smart phones, tablets, and desktop computers. This warranty is void as soon as you tamper with the underlying code of your website.</p>
		
		<h3>How do I start?</h3>
		<p>Send me an <a href="mailto:saeid@fastmail.fm">email</a> with your contact information and/or any questions you have and I will get back to you as soon as possible. You can also reach me on WhatsApp or Signal at +49 176 8826 9966.</p>
