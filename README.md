# Request-response life-cycle for blog homepage (/blog)

1. Browser sends a get request for `/blog` to the server.
1. A rewrite rule in `/vercel.json` redirects request to `/api/blog` endpoint before request reaches the server ([Rewrites on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/rewrites)). The `/api/blog` endpoint is a serverless Node.js function hosted on Vercel.
2. The endpoint connects to a MongoDB database and fetches all the blog posts.
1. If request has a query `response=json` the script returns all blog posts as json in response, otherwise it continues with the next steps.
1. The script on server reads file `/public/blog-template.html` from disc. This file which contains layout for the blog page doesn't exist in repository and is generated by frontend build via GitHub Actions during deployment.
2. The endpoint converts blog posts data into markup using [Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars) and [Marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked) libraries,
3. The endpoint injects the markup into blog layout file,
